# ChaosMode
Chaos Mode is a single-file stress-test and glitch toolkit for sites you control. It blends brute-force layout breakage, random DOM chaos, structured degradations, and broadcast-style glitch overlays. Built to expose weak points, simulate failure, and turn collapse into aesthetic experiment.
